1. Looking at how the data comes out, the size seems to grow as the level, to say, is filled. Essentiall, filling something at height 2 is a lot easier than filling at height 20 because at height 20 there are so many nodes to be filled for that height compared to 2 at height 2. I expected this because it makes sense that every height doubles the required nodes from the previous height.
2. While the ASSSet beat the BST for the Great Gatsby, the BST was better for The Metamorphoses and Complete Shakespeare. The difference is also significant (ex. Complete Shakespeare: BST: 380,876,800 vs ASSSet: 1,688,082,700).
I think the potential reason for this is that for the most part, BSTs are quicker than ASSSets and also they are better for checking if something is already present (comparison vs searching whole set).
